# PortfolioAnalysisMonorepo

### Introduction

The idea behind this project is to automate investment analysis by creating a data pipeline. 
I currently research stocks in my portfolio and watchlist via Google Sheets. This requires 
some manual work for each stock. The goal is to automate this manual work via the data pipeline
which will just require a list of tickers. 

#### Underlying Valuation Technique
The underlying valuation technique is not a DCF or anything super complex -- it's a simple formula
adapted from Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor. It attempts to come up with a valuation of a stock,
or more so a price estimate that could be compared with the actual market price to make an investment
decision. TODO finish this section and include image of the formula... comment on how this is speculative,
and even the future growth estimates hold more predictive power than I could ever have...
